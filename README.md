**Company:** CypherPay  
**Lead:** Kosarachi Arole (Founder & Product Designer)


##  Overview

FindMyCard is a smart feature that will be added to a debit or credit card linked to a mobile app, created to help users prevent card fraud, recover lost cards, and instantly manage card activity. It’s designed for users who value control, security, and peace of mind in their financial transactions.

##  Key Conceptual Features

- GPS integration for real-time card location (via connected app)
- Instant disable / enable functionality through mobile app
- Smart notifications for unauthorized movement or use
- Privacy-focused control over card settings and data
